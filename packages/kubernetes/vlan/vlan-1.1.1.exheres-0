DESCRIPTION="The vlan plugin creates a vlan subinterface off an enslaved interface in the host network namespace and the container using a veth device. One end of the veth pair is placed inside a container and the other end is a subinterface off the master in the host network namespace. The host-local IPAM plugin can be used to allocate an IP address to the container. The traffic of the container interface will be routed through the interface of the host."
