DESCRIPTION="Dummy is a useful feature for routing packets through the Linux kernel without transmitting. Like loopback, it is a purely virtual interface that allows packets to be routed to a designated IP address. Unlike loopback, the IP address can be arbitrary and is not restricted to the 127.0.0.0/8 range."
PLATFORMS="~amd64"
