DESCRIPTION="The ptp plugin creates a point-to-point link between a container and the host by using a veth device. One end of the veth pair is placed inside a container and the other end resides on the host. The host-local IPAM plugin can be used to allocate an IP address to the container. The traffic of the container interface will be routed through the interface of the host."
