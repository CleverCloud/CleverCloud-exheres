DESCRIPTION="With dhcp plugin the containers can get an IP allocated by a DHCP server already running on your network. This can be especially useful with plugin types such as macvlan . Because a DHCP lease must be periodically renewed for the duration of container lifetime, a separate daemon is required to be running. The same plugin binary can also be run in the daemon mode."
